# Python 3 Exercises - Learn Python the Hard Way
This repository contains my personal practice exercises while studying the book "Learn Python 3 the Hard Way" by Zed A. Shaw.

## Notes
All code is rewritten and added more examples by myself as part of the learning process.

Not official solutions from the book's author.
